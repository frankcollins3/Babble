# Babble
self-parsing compiler for personality pinpointing (non startup non significant just idea concept)
// note working on attempt at startup so these concepts may be !organized. Just connecting dots (if) in simples/generals

# where idea came from:
Dr. Daniel Amen mentions how chronic-workaholism can determine brain changes similarly to chronic drug use. 

Let's imagine a hypothetical case where someone looks into different personality disorders.
Perhaps said person may have, arbitrary or not, objective(ish?) information like MBTI, IQ.

Person wanting answers about themselves, before visiting a Dr. Daniel Amen kind of guy, could 
hypothetical i.e: 
what if someone went about much of life without talking, had more Introverted personality type and looks up cluster-A fearful types and makes associations

Look up behaviors one would want to reduce/eliminate, see where they started, and see if connections between:
personality type, behaviors, presumed personality problems.

# UI:
graphs like below

# Naming:
(again not a startup but maintaining ideas reflex):

Guesst -> Guess T -> Guess Therapy (did this before winding down wasn't loving the idea but no time to work on words)

Babble: 
somewhat play on words because one could say the identifying and assuming and making connections, whether they are really there is like crazy person babbling.
But the parsely nature, especially in just now finding out React.Js Babel takes future JS code and makes it relevant now.
This is almost the opposite it tries to parse the past and re-render those understands for it to have use in present.
